The Gaming Room Software Design Document

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  The client was The Gaming Room, the software was a game called "Draw it or Lose it". The requirements were to create a web-based game application that was scalable and able to run on multiple different operating systems.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  In this document I think I did well explaining the needs of the application. I was able to consicely reccomend the best way to go about developing the application as well as which operating system would work best for the game.
  
  What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
    I found the UML and Domain model very helpful. Following the UML I was able to build out the code and create a working program that fit the clients specifications.
    
 If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I would improve the evaluations chart. I would like to go more in-depth with the my evaluations for each operating platform.
  
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  I myself am a gamer. I have used a lot of web-based games and was able to draw from my personal experience, as well as my peers experience to put together a good understanding of what a user looks for in a game like "Draw it or Lose it". The user's needs are imperitive when designing a game because if the game is counter-intuitive, or something that could lessen the users experience it can result in a program that people do not want to use. 
  
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  In this case, I used my own experience (and that of my peers) to design the software. As someone who has a passion for games I was able to consider things that users do and do not like in a game and implement that into the design. In the future I would like to further study the market that the application will be a part of (in this case, it was gaming). Studying the market will allow me to analyze what potential users look for in the application as well as what they tend to avoid.
